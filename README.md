Sisyphus is a game developed for IEEE RetroJam 2025 with the theme "Rebirth", achieving 2nd place overall under the theme of Rebirth. The game traps players in a haunting cycle of their own creation, telling the tale of a man consumed by his terror of mortality. In his desperation, he makes a fateful pact with the Devil, trading his soul for eternal life—only to discover that immortality comes with a price far darker than death itself.

However, the Devil, with his wicked sense of irony, granted the wish by condemning the man to an infinite loop—a seemingly endless, monotonous repetition of his last days. There is no death, but also no progress, no change, and no end.

The objective is simple, yet monumental: break the cycle. You must navigate this looping existence and find a way to confront the Devil once more, not to ask for eternal life, but to beg for freedom from it, even if that freedom means the final peace of oblivion. The game explores the true meaning of "life" when progress is impossible, and the painful irony of being reborn into the same few hours, forever.
